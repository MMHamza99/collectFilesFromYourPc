$ run code and inout extension you need collect like "py"
$ input target folder name - that will put files in it- name like "target"  ""should be an existed folder""
$ wait to done


# libraries :
$ glob => to extract all files and folders we need "pip install glob" 
$ shutil => to copy files from old folder to new target folder "pip install shutil"
